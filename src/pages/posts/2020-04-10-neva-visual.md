  Let the people who wanna live live 
  Sometimes weird is great and great is weird 
  Weird is there and were just here 
  And where that leave us? 
  To a place where you disappear 
  No one cheers 
  I love celebration And that’s real
  If that girl never pass go and collect the dough would she go straight to jail
  She grew bored of games looked me in my eye and said all y’all are the same 
  And That boy that’s on the edge he need you would you give em a hand 
  And you saw you that man with the sign on the street 
  Did you give that man a dollar for lunch 
  Even though you had a dollar in yo pocket 
  What you think he would do something toxic 
  you in a rush, I don’t even doubt 
  I move on I just don’t analyze em 
  Naw, yea yea yea yea 

  You keep me up to date the way you move by web
  I Wish that you would call me when ya ass need help 
  But I understand yo mind frame to move by self 
  But My cousin said you asked about me soon as I left 
  Trynna understand relationship down to detail 
  Still working on myself before I lose you 
  Gotta find myself before I lose you 
  Thinking to my myself do I use you 
  Didn’t even know that I abuse you 
  Got me out here singing like I’m U2 


  I just know I need you 
  I want you to need me 
  But Neva Eva need me 
  Don’t say I’m being needy
  Don’t say I’m being needy 

  I just wanna invest you 
  You expect the best me 
  I expect the best from me too
  How we find the best to you
  Forreal 
  We gotta find the best for you
  Thinking to myself I am the best for you 
  Gotta find the best for you 


  Who does the guy that everyone goes to go to when he needs someone to go to
  That’s the God truth 
  I need accountability 
  I need an ear when no one wants to listen 
  When no one is efficient 
  When you feel distant 
  I need your assistance 
  I don’t want attention 
  But I want your attention 

  I just know I 
  I want you to
  But Neva Eva 
  Don’t say I’m being needy 
  I just know I need you 
  I want you to need me 
  But Neva Eva need me 
  Don’t say I’m being needy
